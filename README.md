# much todo about null

Much todo about null is a todo app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) for Android and iOS. 

It uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for real-time cloud sync across your devices and persists local db changes to the device, automagically re-syncing when data or wifi is avaialble.

It's simple and lightweight. Features will include:

* adding new todos
* filtering todos based on date
* setting up notifications to stay on track

Potential cool features:

* tags to filter todos based on task type (potentially subtle color codes)
* contextual reminders (time-of-day, day-of-week, location-based)
* subtasks within a todo: checklists to complete subtasks a % complete tracker
  * e.g., 10 steps total, did 6/10, have 4 more to go
* task dependencies -- have to complete Y before completing X
* grouping TODOs

Keeping track of goal completion status from week-to-week and assigning a score so you can identify if you're getting the things done that you need to get done.
